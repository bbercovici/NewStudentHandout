\subsubsection{Sublime Text}
Sublime Text is advertised as "a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose". Sublime Text can be extended by means of plugins adding all sorts of capabilities to this already really powerful software. For instance, Python and C++ code can be run within Sublime by simply pressing $\cmd + $B. Multi-line editing is also a huge plus.
