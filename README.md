This repo stores the .tex files used to compile a list of tips and tricks for new ASEN PhD students at the ORCCA lab from CU Boulder. The topics that are covered as of now include LaTeX, Git and GitHub and Asymptote.

Users can either clone the entire repository and compile the example by themselves, or see the latest version of the pdf [in the ORCCA shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B7mRKAXpuZ-bdS1mVXdkWWRoQzA).

New content can be added by cloning the repository after asking myself for collaborator rights.
