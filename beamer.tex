\section{Beamer}
Beamer is described as "a LaTeX class to create powerful, flexible and nice-looking presentations and slides"\footnote{https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Beamer}. 
\subsection{Installation}
There is nothing to install, as Beamer is just a LaTeX class (whose definition is already included in the LaTeX distribution of your choice). 
\subsection{Usage}
Since Beamer heavily builds upon LaTeX, there are very little new commands that you need to know. LaTeX maths commands work just as well in Beamer as they do within a report class. In order to turn your classic LaTeX report into a Beamer presentation, 
simply replace
\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{report}
\end{lstlisting}

by
\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{beamer}
\end{lstlisting}
at the beginning of your LaTeX report.
An alternative is also to add the following option to the \textit{documentclass} command, which will set the aspect ratio of the slides to $16\/9$

\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass[aspectratio=169]{beamer}
\end{lstlisting}

The two other fundamental environments are \textit{frame} and \textit{block} (and its derivatives \textit{exampleblock} and \textit{alertblock}. The former allows you to create a frame by wrapping the frame content inside it. The latter are wrapping containers (blue, green and red respectively).\\ A difference with standard LaTeX classes such as \textit{report} is that the \textit{chapter} command will not work in Beamer.

Finally, another useful command is \textit{pause}, which introduces a "pause" transition by splitting a frame into two slides.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption = Frame and block example]
\begin{frame}{my frame title (optional)}

\begin{block}{Here is a block title! (recommended)}

\end{block}

\begin{alertblock}{Here is an alertblock title! (recommended)}
\pause

\end{alertblock}

\begin{exampleblock}{Here is an exampleblock title! (recommended)}

\end{exampleblock}

\end{frame}
\end{lstlisting}
